#
# Sample jacomax.properties file which the MaximaPropertiesConfigurer class
# can read in to find out where Maxima lives and how it should be called up.
#
# Usage Notes
# ===========
#
# * The default constructor of MaximaPropertiesConfigurer will search for
# a file called jacomax.properties firstly in the current directory, then in
# your home directory, then finally in the ClassPath. (This behaviour is
# probably suitable for most general uses. For more control over how this
# works, please refer to the documentation for MaximaPropertiesConfigurer for
# full details.)
#
# * You can use this file as a template for your own jacomax.properties.
# You will need to fill in a few details, as shown below.
#
# * If you want to run the Jacomax test suite, you must make a copy of this
# file called jacomax.properties and store it in your home directory
# BEFORE running the test suite.

#
# REQUIRED PROPERTIES
# ===================
#
# You need to tell Jacomax where Maxima lives on your computer so that Jacomax
# can run Maxima and communicate with it.
#
# Please consult the section that matches the type of computer you're using
# and uncomment the appropriate configuration properties.
#
# Linux
# -----
#
# Maxima is normally installed in /usr/bin/maxima, or somewhere similar, which
# is a little shell script that gets everything up and running.
#
# Uncomment the following, making sure it points to your Maxima:
#
#jacomax.maxima.path=/usr/bin/maxima
#
# If you're an expert, you way want to directly invoke the appropriate Lisp
# runtime yourself.
#
# You may pass additional command line arguments and environment variables
# using optional properties of the following form:
#
#jacomax.maxima.arg0=
#jacomax.maxima.arg1=
#...
#jacomax.maxima.env0=
#jacomax.maxima.env1=
#...
#
#
# Mac OS X
# --------
#
# If you installed Maxima in your Applications folder, then uncomment the following
# line:
#
#jacomax.maxima.path=/Applications/Maxima.app/Contents/Resources/bin/maxima
#
# If you installed Maxima via MacPorts, then you will want to uncomment:
#
#jacomax.maxima.path=/opt/local/bin/maxima
#jacomax.maxima.env0=PATH=/opt/local/bin\:/bin\:/usr/bin
#
# Consult the Linux section above if you want to pass additional command line
# parameters or environment variables, or want to invoke a specific Lisp runtime.
#
#
# Windows
# -------
#
# If you have installed the Maxima via the self-contained installer from its
# download page, then you'll want to uncomment the following line (and amend
# the version number as appropriate):
#
#jacomax.maxima.path=C\:\\Program Files\\Maxima-5.20.1\\bin\\maxima.bat
#
# Please note that in this case, Jacomax will actually end up invoking:
#
# C:\Program Files\Maxima-5.20.1\lib\maxia\5.20.1\binary-gcl\maxima.exe ...
#
# with appropriate extra arguments so that it can safely kill the Maxima process
# if it needs to. If this doesn't suit you or if you don't want to run Maxima with
# GCL, then you should change this path to suit, passing any command line arguments
# and/or environment variables as described in the Linux section.
#

#
# OPTIONAL/ADVANCED PROPERTIES
# ============================
#
# If you're using a character set other than US-ASCII, then uncomment and amend
# the following to suit:
#jacomax.maxima.charset=US-ASCII
#
#
# Jacomax can kill the Maxima process if a call has not completed within a
# certain time limit. This can be useful in preventing infinite loops, or
# situations where Maxima wants further input that isn't being provided.
#
# The default values are specified below. Uncomment and amend if you want to
# change these. You may need to play about with this to suit the computer
# you're running this stuff from and the kinds of calls you're making.
#
# You can prevent this behaviour happening by setting a negative timeout.
# This should be used with caution!
#jacomax.default.call.timeout=20
#jacomax.default.batch.timeout=60
